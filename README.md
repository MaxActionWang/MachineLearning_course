# MachineLearning_course
This repo mainly consists of my course assignments of the course Machine Learning (course id:80250993-0) in Dept of Automation, Tsinghua Univ.

Most codes are accomplished with Python3.8. Some of those are done with the help of sci-kit learn, pytorch and torchvision.
Applied datasets are ICU, MNIST and CIFAR-10.
